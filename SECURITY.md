## üîê Security Best Practices

### For Users

#### AWS Credentials Management
```bash
# Use IAM roles instead of access keys when possible
aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::account:role/EnforceAI-Role

# Rotate access keys regularly
aws iam update-access-key --access-key-id AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE --status Inactive
```

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Never commit credentials to version control
echo "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key" >> .env
echo ".env" >> .gitignore

# Use AWS Secrets Manager for production
aws secretsmanager create-secret --name "enforce-ai/credentials"
```

#### Network Security
```bash
# Run EnforceAI behind a reverse proxy
# Configure HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
# Implement proper firewall rules
```

### For Developers

#### Secure Coding Practices
```python
# Input validation
import re
from typing import Optional

def validate_resource_id(resource_id: str) -> Optional[str]:
    """Validate AWS resource ID format"""
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9\-_]+$'
    if re.match(pattern, resource_id) and len(resource_id) <= 255:
        return resource_id
    return None

# Secure API calls
import boto3
from botocore.exceptions import ClientError

def secure_aws_call(service: str, operation: str, **kwargs):
    """Make secure AWS API calls with error handling"""
    try:
        client = boto3.client(service)
        response = getattr(client, operation)(**kwargs)
        return response
    except ClientError as e:
        # Log error without exposing sensitive information
        logger.error(f"AWS API call failed: {e.response['Error']['Code']}")
        raise
```

#### Dependency Management
```bash
# Regularly update dependencies
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

# Scan for vulnerabilities
pip install safety
safety check

# Use dependency pinning
pip freeze > requirements-lock.txt
```

## üîç Security Monitoring

### Automated Security Scanning

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security.yml
name: Security Scan
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Bandit Security Scan
        run: |
          pip install bandit
          bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
      - name: Run Safety Check
        run: |
          pip install safety
          safety check --json --output safety-report.json
```

### Security Metrics

We monitor the following security metrics:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API access patterns
- Privilege escalation attempts
- Data access anomalies
- Compliance violation trends
