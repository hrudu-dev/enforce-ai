### Short-Term (Months 1-6)
1. **Reserved Instance Strategy**
   - Purchase 1-year reserved instances for predictable workloads
   - Implement Savings Plans for Lambda and Fargate

2. **Cost Allocation Tags**
   - Tag all resources by customer/environment
   - Implement chargeback model for customers

### Long-Term (Months 6-12)
1. **Multi-Cloud Strategy**
   - Evaluate Azure/GCP for cost arbitrage
   - Implement hybrid cloud for cost optimization

2. **Custom Pricing Negotiations**
   - Enterprise Discount Program with AWS
   - Volume discounts for Bedrock usage
