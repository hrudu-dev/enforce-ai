### Full Narration Script

```
[OPENING - Upbeat, confident tone]
What if compliance could be your competitive advantage instead of your bottleneck?

[PROBLEM - Concerned, urgent tone]
Today's DevOps teams deploy hundreds of times per day, but compliance is stuck in the stone age. 

Seventy-three percent of organizations struggle with continuous compliance monitoring. The average data breach costs four-point-three-five million dollars. And sixty-seven percent of companies fail their regulatory audits.

Manual checklists, weeks-long audit cycles, and reactive violation discovery are killing innovation and putting businesses at risk.

[SOLUTION - Excited, innovative tone]
Meet EnforceAI - the multi-agent compliance revolution powered by Amazon Bedrock.

Three intelligent AI agents work together to transform your compliance from a bottleneck into a competitive advantage.

[DEMO - Professional, explanatory tone]
Watch as our Audit Agent continuously scans your AWS infrastructure in real-time, discovering resources and configurations across EC2, RDS, S3, and more.

Our Compliance Agent, powered by Claude 3 Sonnet, analyzes every resource against GDPR, FISMA, EU AI Act, and ISO standards, providing intelligent assessments in seconds, not weeks.

When violations are found, our Policy Agent doesn't just alert you - it fixes them automatically. Unencrypted databases become encrypted, public buckets become private, and missing backups get configured.

Need guidance? Ask our AI assistant anything about compliance in natural language. "Are we GDPR compliant for our EU customers?" Get instant, intelligent answers.

Generate executive reports with a single click. Beautiful dashboards, trend analysis, and audit-ready documentation - all powered by AI.

[RESULTS - Confident, impressive tone]
The results speak for themselves. Ninety-five percent reduction in manual compliance work. Ninety percent fewer policy violations. Three hundred percent ROI within six months.

[CLOSING - Inspiring, call-to-action tone]
This isn't just automation - it's transformation. EnforceAI doesn't just check compliance, it ensures it, explains it, and evolves with it.
