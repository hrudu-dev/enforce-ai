- **Rate limiting**: API throttling during high usage periods
- **Model availability**: Regional availability varies
- **Cost scaling**: Exponential cost growth with usage

**Mitigation Strategies**:
```python
# Token management
def optimize_prompt(resource_data, framework):
    # Compress data while preserving essential information
    compressed_data = compress_resource_config(resource_data)
    # Use framework-specific prompts to reduce token usage
    return build_optimized_prompt(compressed_data, framework)

# Rate limiting handling
async def bedrock_request_with_retry(prompt, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return await bedrock_client.invoke_model(prompt)
        except RateLimitError:
            await asyncio.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
    raise MaxRetriesExceeded()
```

#### Scalability Constraints
**Current Limitations**:
- **Single-region deployment** in MVP phase
- **Lambda cold starts** impact response times
- **Database connection limits** with high concurrency
- **Memory constraints** for large resource sets
